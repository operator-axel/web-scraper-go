A web scraper built in Go, that asks for user input, domain, subdomain(optional), and the URL/link to scrape. 
The allowed domain input helps to keep the scraper contained to the specific content you want. 

The first prompt is for the 'Title' of the new note - as the scraper parses the links into a bulleted list of *Markdown Links* 
and creates a new note in my Obsidian vault. There is a comment above where the path/to/my/obsidian/vault is - change for your use case.
